# GeneticRaceEditor
Currently semi-finished Track editor and paint tool for my new version of GeneticRaceAI

Allows the use to create tracks using a Spline system edited from a Javidx9 video from youtube. 
Then allows the user to paint/fill/erase the surrounding track, before saving to a .png and yaml format. 

The code in this project hasnt been updated in some time, and really needs to be updated to my new GameEngineSFML version. This will hopefully be completed ASAP
